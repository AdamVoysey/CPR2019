# CPR2019

Write each section as an independent file and use include to stitch
together. Add directories for data and plots/figures. CMM will use
Matplotlib for this. Others don't have to but consistency is
important.

Working on Master should be OK, but one can also make a branch and
issue a pull request when done is OK too.
